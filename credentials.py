# Separate file to hide API keys during development and testing
# CU should think about some method to allow students hide their credentials when uploading a homework
# This file will be pushed in the last commit
# After that it will be private again and previous api key will be blocked to prevent other people form using it

api_key = 'WO2bAzLKX2c2jbGc69CA5CJx3yfQEJy3'
# Also you probably need to set your own key here, because limit get exceeded very fast
